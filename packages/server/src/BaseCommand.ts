 * 
 * @description
 * 
 * - Params is all of the strings before the first option
 * - Options is a hashmap of each option, with either a boolean, or an array of strings.
 * 
 * The option declaration in info determines how it is parsed.
 * 
 * - For options declared with an argument, the value will be an array. 
 *   - If no value is given, the array will be empty.
 *   - If the option is not present in the cli, it will not be added to the hashmap.
 * - For options declared without an argument, the value will be true or it will not be present.
