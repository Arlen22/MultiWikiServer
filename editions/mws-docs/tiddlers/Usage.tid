Once MWS is successfully [[installed|Installation]], you can access it by visiting http://localhost:8080 in a browser on the same computer.

On first start, a default user is created with username `admin` and password `1234`. However, also by default, the server is only accessible to browsers on the same machine.

If you intend to put an MWS installation on a public network like the Internet, the server will need to be secured with the following steps:

* Change the administrator password.
* Install HTTPS server certificates.
