# MultiWikiServer
MultiWikiServer for TiddlyWiki

### Testing

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Then navigate to https://localhost:5000/test/, which currently just 
forwards requests to a loaded instance of the TiddlyWiki server.
Changes should sync to the editions/mws-server folder.
