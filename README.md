# MultiWikiServer
MultiWikiServer for TiddlyWiki

### How to run

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

### New server

The main server instance runs on port 5000. The code for it is at the end of `src/server.ts`.

### Old server

The old `npm start` runs on port 5001. This will go away eventually but it's still there for easy reference while we transfer everything over. The code for this is in `src/routes/tw-test.ts`.
