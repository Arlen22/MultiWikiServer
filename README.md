# MultiWikiServer

**This is not ready for primetime. Do not use it to protect feelings or intellectual property.**

*You really shouldn't be using it to store anything important yet. It is still in the VERY early stages of development and we don't even have proper tests verifying the security mechanisms yet. So please try it out, kick the tires, import your multi-gigabyte wikis and play around with it, but don't actually store anything you want to keep. We'll hopefully get there soon, but even the database schema itself is still in flux as we figure out what the best layout is for all the stuff we have planned.*

Multiple users, multiple wikis for TiddlyWiki.

- Bag & Recipe system for storing tiddlers.
- User and Role management with ACL.
- Multiple database engines supported, using Prisma.
- Third-party OAuth and password-based login.

## Flexible and Extendible 

- Plugins can add routes and hooks.
- Abstractions everywhere, allowing flexibility.
- The source code is fully typed and easy to navigate.
- Admin endpoints can also be called from the CLI.

Most of these features are still in development.

## How to run

The init command creates a new folder and installs what you need to get started. 

- `npm init @tiddlywiki/mws@latest mws`
- `cd mws`
- `npm start`

You can customize the defaults by modifying `mws.run.mjs`.

- the server runs on port `5000`. It does not use HTTPS by default, but you can enable it by specifying a key and cert. 
- A `localpass.key` file is created to hold the password keyfile. If this file changes, all passwords will need to be reset. 
- The data folder (`wikiPath`) is `wiki` by default.

The initial user created on first run has the username `admin` and password `1234`.

If you run into trouble, or need help figuring something out, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/MultiWikiServer/discussions). If you know what's wrong, you can also open an issue.


### Updates

This is the process for updating to a new version of MWS.

- Copy or zip your `store` folder to **a safe backup folder**.
- `npm install @tiddlywiki/mws@latest`
- Run `npm start`. This will update the database schema automatically if there are new changes.

If there are any database changes, MWS should pick them up and apply them. The changes are generated by prisma's builtin migration and are supposed to preserve data, but backups are still highly recommended.

### Development

If you want to work on the project, 

- `git clone https://github.com/TiddlyWiki/MultiWikiServer`
- `cd MultiWikiServer`
- `npm install` or `npm run install-android`
- `cd react-user-mgmt`
- `npm install`
- `cd ..`
- `npm run certs` - if you want https (unix only)
- `npm start` - this runs the build and test every time, but it's pretty fast

The development wiki will be active at http://localhost:8080/dev

You can change the listeners as explained in the mws.dev.mjs file.
